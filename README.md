# RC_Projects

## Grade: 17/20 ⭐️

These projects were developed for the Computer Networks (Pt - Redes de Computadores) course of the Software Engineering degree at U.Minho for the 2023/2024 year. The main tools used were WireShark and the CORE platform - The Common Open Research Emulator.

CORE provides an open-source emulation environment that uses existing operating system virtualization techniques to build wired and wireless networks where protocols and applications can run without any modification. As a real-time emulator, these networks can be connected to real networks, extending the test environments to real equipment.
